Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
make: 'cyoa-step1' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
make: 'cyoa-step2' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step2 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 2
------------------------------------


2.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 story1  <  story1/inputs/input0.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


2.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 story1  <  story1/inputs/input1.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


2.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 story1  <  story1/inputs/input2.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 2

Step 3
Checking that cyoa-step3 compiles
make: 'cyoa-step3' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step3 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 3
------------------------------------
------------------------------------
You have requested that we check for intermediate deadline completion on step 3
------------------------------------

Step 3 EC intermediate deadline test 1
===========================================================
./cyoa-step3 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean for this testcase
You have passed this test case

Step 3 EC intermediate deadline test 2
===========================================================
./cyoa-step3 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean for this testcase
You have passed this test case
Intermediate deadline requirements for Step 3 passed at Sat Nov 26 10:40:55 AM EST 2022

Step 4
Checking that cyoa-step4 compiles
make: 'cyoa-step4' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step4 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 4
------------------------------------
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 4

You have passed the test cases YOU provided
If your tests are good, this is great. 
If your tests are insufficient, you should do much more testing
