Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
make: 'cyoa-step1' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
g++ -o cyoa-step2 -ggdb3 -std=gnu++98 -Wall -Werror -pedantic cyoa-step2.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step2 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 2
------------------------------------


2.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step2 story1  <  ./story1/inputs/input0.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 2

Step 3
Checking that cyoa-step3 compiles
The code did not compile!
